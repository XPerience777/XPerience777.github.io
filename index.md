# 1. Professional Self-Assessment

I have been getting my bachelor’s degree in computer science since fall of 2019. I went to in person classes at SIUE for 2 years before COVID struck. I had to transition to online remote learning with SNHU for the remaining 2-3 years of my degree before Graduating in the spring of 2024. Thus, taking a total of 5 years to earn my bachelor’s degree in CS. 
While studying CS in university I have learned many core skills that helped me develop in my field. Being able to troubleshoot and research on the fly, how to use proper coding practices to make secure code that’s easy to read, and how to code and develop programs in Java, C++ ,C , and Python with various sub languages along the way. 
I’m looking to enter the workforce searching for an IT based occupation. Some job opportunities I’m looking at currently are software engineering, systems analysis, and networking. I’m fast to learn new techniques and I enjoy working with others in my field so I’m looking forward to the beginning of my carrier where I can begin to train in my field.
