# 1. Professional Self-Assessment

I have been getting my bachelor’s degree in computer science since fall of 2019. I went to in person classes at SIUE for 2 years before COVID struck. I had to transition to online remote learning with SNHU for the remaining 2-3 years of my degree before Graduating in the spring of 2024. Thus, taking a total of 5 years to earn my bachelor’s degree in CS. 
While studying CS in university I have learned many core skills that helped me develop in my field. Being able to troubleshoot and research on the fly, how to use proper coding practices to make secure code that’s easy to read, and how to code and develop programs in Java, C++ ,C , and Python with various sub languages along the way. 
I’m looking to enter the workforce searching for an IT based occupation. Some job opportunities I’m looking at currently are software engineering, systems analysis, and networking. I’m fast to learn new techniques and I enjoy working with others in my field so I’m looking forward to the beginning of my carrier where I can begin to train in my field.

# 2. Artifact 1
### Enhancement 1: Software Design and Engineering

This artifact was an OpenGL program developed in C++ that renders a 3D scene of my personal desk space. It was my final for my online CS330 course at SNHU back in early 2023.

##### Narrative

I included this artifact because it was left in a state that I knew I could improve greatly within a reasonable amount of time. It also fits 2 of the 3 categorical improvements required for my CS499 capstone project.
It also allows me to present my skills in OpenGL and C++ coding while using best coding practices such as proper structure, spelling, commenting, and iterative development.
When I originally submitted the code, it had a very simple scene that was simply floating in a void. I set out to improve this scene by fully modeling a room designed around my current desk workspace setup and layout.
I have implemented proper structure, naming, spelling, and commenting in my code to help with the readability and clarity in the code. Over the course of the artifact’s development, I have created many supplementary documents, plans, and code reviews to help with the outside development and understanding of my project. The project uses techniques I’ve learned during my time at SNHU varying from basic C++ coding to the implementation of OpenGL libraries and techniques that build a digital 3D scene. I applied proper computer science practices and standards to all of my code while properly updating the data structures and algorithms such as the stored data for lighting, reflections, textures, and the rendering algorithm updated with a multisampling antialiasing algorithm.
The original code only has a handful of flat low-resolution textures with lighting that just floated aimlessly to light the scene with no real direction in mind just so it looked vaguely like the source scene. I decided to create custom textures by photographing the object in my room the scene is based off of using my phone. This way the scene could be textured with a one-to-one look to the reference material. 
I then set out to update the lighting to originate from the models that reference the scene’s lamp lighting, so the reflections and lighting direction looked more organic. I added a light for the overhead ceiling lamp, the standing lamp, and a light for the screen and keyboard light. Each has a color and lighting intensity unique to each of them that matches their real-life counterparts. I also softened the reflection intensity for each light individually to show the different diffusion levels through the lamp shades. Lastly, I added multisample x16 anti-aliasing (MSAA) to the rendering algorithm to smooth out the edges of the models to give a smoother and softer look with less pixelization.
